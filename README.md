## About

Got some competitive programming problems, but you can't host them online (or you wanna do them offline)? Judgel got you covered!

Judgel is a simple and easy to use C++ judge that can be run locally and offline. It has all the verdicts and functions a typical online judge would have.

You only need 3 simple step to start using Judgel! 

üåü If you find this helpful, consider [staring this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars)! It supports me as a student!

## Prerequisites
1. **Windows 11** (Windows 10 is not recommended)
2. **GCC C++ compiler** (g++, MinGW-w64)
    - Check it out: [No yapping installation guide](https://hadrianlau.com/blog/no-yap-mingw-w64-guide)
## Installation 
1. **[Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udontur/judgel/main/app/judgel.msi)** to download
2. **Open the installer** and press ```Run anyway```
    - Judgel is not a virus (I know this is what a virus would say)
    - You can check the [sourc code here](https://github.com/udontur/judgel/src)
3. **Click ```Next``` or ```Install```** until you see the ```Finish``` button
    - Extra: You can check the installation by typing ```judgel``` in a new terminal
## Usage (Method 1, recommended)
```judgel``` works in **a terminal** (CMD or PowerShell) 
Type ```judgel``` for about and help page. 
### Prerequisites 
1. Your testcase folder **must** be named ```testcase```
2. Your code file **must** be named ```main.cpp```
3. You **must** be on the **folder** that contain the above items
    -  Command: ```cd <YOUR_FOLDER_PATH>```

### Syntax
```judgel <TIME_LIMIT(s, int)>```

### Example
- Time limit: 2 seconds (must be an **integer** in **seconds**)
- Testcase path: ```C:\Users\udontur\code\WT00A\testcase```
- Code path: ```C:\Users\udontur\code\WT00A\main.cpp```
- The current directory is ```C:\Users\udontur\code\WT00A```

Command: ```judgel 3```

The terminal's looks: ```C:\Users\udontur\code\WT00A> judgel 3```
## Usage (Method 2)
This method requires more typing, but there are **no prerequisties**
#### Syntax
```judgel <TIME_LIMIT(s, int)> <TESTCASE/PATH> <CODE/PATH>```

Example (Time limit must be an **integer** in **seconds**)
- Time limit: 2 seconds
- Testcase path: ```C:\Users\udontur\Documents\WT00A\testcase```
- Code path: ```C:\Users\udontur\code\i luv cs\a.cpp```

Command: ```judgel 2 "C:\Users\udontur\Documents\WT00A\testcase" "C:\Users\udontur\code\i luv cs\a.cpp"``` 

Note 1: Relative paths is also accepted
Note 2: Paths that contain spaces must be wrapped with ```"```
