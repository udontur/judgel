## About

Got some competitive programming problems, but you can't host them online (or you wanna do them offline)? Judgel got you covered!

Judgel is a simple and easy to use C++ judge that can be run locally and offline. It has all the verdicts and functions a typical online judge would have.

You only need 3 simple step to start using Judgel!
